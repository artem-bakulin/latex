\begin{frame}{Credit default swap}
\justify
A \alert{credit default swap (CDS)} is a financial derivative that allows buying or selling insurance against default on bonds or other debts.

\justify
Key parameters of a swap:

\justify
1. Reference entity: the entity whose default is covered by the insurance. E.g. FooBar LLC. It is neither buyer nor seller of the swap, it does not take part in the contract

\justify
2. Notional amount or insured amount. E.g. \$10\,000\,000.

\justify
3, Coverage period. E.g. starting today and ending in a year.

\justify
4, Fixed coupon (spread): percentage of the notional amount which the buyer pays to the seller. E.g. 2\% annually.

\justify
Buying a CDS means agreeing to pay fixed coupons in exchange for insurance.

\justify
Suppose that a default has happened

1. Insured notional amount \$10\,000\,000.

2. Market price of the defaulted bond is \$4\,000\,000.

\justify
\alert{Deliverable} credit default swap:

1. The buyer hands over defaulted bonds to the seller.

2. The seller pays the buyer full notional amount (\$10\,000\,000).

\justify
\alert{Cash-settled} credit default swap:

1. The seller pays the buyer the difference between notional amount and market value of the bonds  (\$6\,000\,000).

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Hedging credit risk}
\justify
Suppose we own a corporate bond. Negative news has been announced, and now we are concerned that the probability of default has increased. We have two options:

1. Sell the bond on the market.

2. Buy insurance, i.e. buy a credit default swap.

\justify
In theory, if there was an ideal perfectly liquid market for bonds, we would sell the bond immediately at zero bid/ask spread. In practice, it may take weeks to find a buyer for an illiquid security..

\justify
Sometimes buying a credit default swap may be simpler and more cost-effective than selling an illiquid bond. When (and if) the market stabilizes we sill sell the swap.

\justify
Credit default swaps are particularly useful for hedging non-traded debts, such as bank loans.
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Speculating on credit risk}

\justify
We have a view that creditworthiness of a reference entity will deteriorate in future. Our options are:

1. Sell short the risky bond and buy a risk-free government bond (to eliminate the general interest rate risk).

2. Buy a credit default swap.

\justify
Do you have to own a bond  to buy a CDS? No! This position would be called a naked CDS (*).

\justify
A small bank could be selling credit default swaps to diversify its credit portfolio. It could "make loans"\ to companies (reference entities) that would never speak to this bank otherwise.

\justify
(*) The EU regulation prohibits naked CDS in case reference entity is one of the EU governments.

A few factors affect fair price of a CDS.

1. Probability of default. It can be estimated from other CDS quotes or from market prices for this entity's bonds.

\justify
2. Recovery rate is residual value of a bond in case of default. Usually it is estimated from historical data for particular jurisdiction, economy sector, credit rating.

\justify
3. Discounting interest rate for future cash flows.

\begin{frame}{Bond price and probability of default}
\justify
A risk-free zero-coupon government bond that matures in 1 year is priced at $G=98\%$ of its face value. If you invest \$980 today you receive \$1\,000 in a year. Rate of return is $\$1\,000 / \$980 - 1 \approx 2.04\%$.

\justify
A corporate bond of the same maturity is priced at $C=95\%$ of its face value. If you invest \$950 today, you receive \$1\,000 in a year (in case there is no default). Rate of return is $\$1\,000 / \$950 - 1 \approx 5.3\%$.

\justify
Why do market participants value the corporate bond less, i.e. demand higher rate of return?

\justify
Suppose that the recovery rate in case of default is $R=40\%$. You invest \$950 today and receive \$400 in a year. Rate of return in case of default is $\$400 / \$950 - 1 = -57.9\%$.
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Bond price and probability of default - 2}

Government bond is worth $G=98\%$ of its face value, corporate bond is worth $C=95\%$, recovery rate in case of default is $R=40\%$.

Corp. & 0.95 & 0.4 & 0.4/0.95 - 1 & 1 & 1/0.95 - 1
\end{tabular}

\justify
Expected rates of return should be equal:
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{0.98} - 1 &= p\left(\frac{0.4}{0.95} - 1\right) + (1-p)\left(\frac{1}{0.95} - 1\right) \Rightarrow \\
p &= \frac{1 - C/G}{1-R} = \frac{1 - 0.95/0.98}{1-0.4} \approx 5.1\%

\begin{align*}
p = \frac{1 - \dfrac{C}{G}}{1-R} = \frac{1 - \dfrac{(1 + r_g)^T}{(1 + r_c)^T}}{1 - R}

In case interest rates are not too high, we can simplify the formula:

What is probability that the bank will default during a year?
\begin{equation*}
p \approx \frac{r_{Bank} - r_{Germany}}{1-R} = \frac{4.2\% - 3.6\%}{1-40\%} = 1.00\%

Suppose we are flipping a coin. Probability of Tails outcome is $p$ (usually it is close to 50\%). We continue flipping the coin until the first Tails outcome (a default). We are interested in a random variable $\xi$ which is the number or Heads until the first Tails (years without a default).

\justify
What is probability that the first Tail will occur not sooner than in the $n$-th trial (i.e. we get at least $n$ Heads in a row)?
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{P}(\xi \ge n) = S(n) = (1 - p)^{n}

Suppose that the default may happen at any time, not just once a year. Suppose that during any tiny time interval $dt$ a default may happen with probability of $\lambda \cdot dt$. $\lambda$ is called \alert{hazard rate} and it is usually expressed in percent per annum.

\justify
Probability that a reference entity survives till time $T$ is $S(T)$. What is probability that it will survive a bit longer?
\begin{align*}
S(T+dt) = S(T)(1 - \lambda dt)
\end{align*}

\justify
Rearranging the terms and solving a tiny differential equation:
\begin{align*}
\frac{S(T+dt) - S(T)}{dt} = -\lambda S(T) \quad
\Rightarrow
\quad
S(T) = e^{-\lambda T}

We can derive the value of $\lambda$ from $S(T_1)$ and $S(T_2)$.
\begin{align*}
S(T_2) = S(T_1)e^{-\lambda(T_2-T_1)}
\end{align*}
Consequently
\begin{align*}
\lambda = \dfrac{\ln\left(\dfrac{S(T_1)}{S(T_2)}\right)}{T_2 - T_1} = \dfrac{\ln\left(\dfrac{1 - D(T_1)}{1 - D(T_2)}\right)}{T_2 - T_1}
\end{align*}
In our particular case, $\lambda \approx 3.11\%$. So we can interpolate the value of $D(1.5)$:
\begin{align*}
D(1.5) = 1 - S(1.5) = 1 - (1 - D(1))e^{-3.11\% \cdot (1.5 - 1)} \approx 3.51\%

Find fair price (coupon) for a credit default swap under following assumptions.

\begin{itemize}
\justifying
\item Term is 1 year.
\item Quarterly coupons (every 1/4th of a year).
\item Recovery rate is 40\%.
\item Probability of default is given by a exponential distribution with hazard rate of $\lambda = 2\%$.
\item In case of a default, the notional amount will be paid on the following coupon date. The swap is cash-settled.
\item Neglect the discounting.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Solution}

Let $x$ be an annual coupon rate. Swap notional is $\$1$, recovery rate is $R$. Let $S(t)$ be probability of the reference entity surviving for $t$ years. Write down all payments of the seller and the buyer, along with probabilities of these payments.

\justify
Probability of the reference entity surviving during 1/4 of a year is $S(1/4) = 98\%$. Probability of the reference entity surviving during 1/2 of a year is $S(1/2) = 95\%$. 

\justify
What is probability that the reference entity will default at any time between 1/4 and 1/2 (during the second quarter)? 

\justify
Consider a sample of 100\,000 entities that are alive today.

\justify
98\,000 (98\% of the initial population) of these will survive during the first quarter. 

\justify
95\,000 (95\% of the initial population) will survive for half a year.

\justify
3\,000 will default during the second quarter. This is $98\% - 95\% = 3\%$ of the initial population. An entity that is alive today has a probability of 3\% of defaulting precisely during the second quarter (not earlier, not later)
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Solution - 3}
\justify
Expected value of the buyer's payments should be equal to expected value of the seller's payments

\begin{equation*}
\frac{x}{4} \cdot \left( S\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) + S\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + S\left(\frac{3}{4}\right) +S\left(1\right) \right) = (1 - R)(1 - S(1))
\end{equation*}

According to the problem statement, $S(t)=e^{-\lambda t}$, so

\begin{equation*}
x = \frac{4(1 - R)(1 - e^{-\lambda})}{e^{-\lambda / 4} + e^{-\lambda / 2} + e^{-3\lambda / 4} + e^{-\lambda}}
\end{equation*}

Substitute $R = 0.4$ and $\lambda = 0.02$:

\begin{equation*}
\frac{4(1 - 0.4)(1 - e^{-0.02})}{e^{-0.02 / 4} + e^{-0.02 / 2} + e^{-3\cdot0.02 / 4} + e^{-0.02}} \approx 1.203\%
\end{equation*}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Solution (a shortcut)}
\justify
Probability that the reference entity will survive for 1 year is $S(1) = e^{-\lambda \cdot 1} \approx 1 - \lambda = 0.98$.

\justify
Probability of a default during 1 year is $\approx 2\%$. If the default happens you lose $1 - R = 0.6$ or $60\%$.

\justify
How much would you pay for insurance, if you know that the credit event will happen with probability of 2\% and will cost you 60\% of the invested capital? Certainly, $2\% \cdot 60\% = 1.2\%$!

Not quite. Usually the market overestimates the probability of default. On average, companies go bankrupt less frequently than market quotes imply.

All investors are \alert{risk-neutral} in our model. Risk-neutral investors care only about the expected rate of return and do not care about the risk (variance).

New BMW X5 costs \EUR{100\,000}. Comprehensive insurance for a year costs \EUR{4\,000}. Probability that your lecturer will crash the car within a year is 2\%. After an incident the car is worth zero. Should the lecturer insure the car?

\justify
Expected value with insurance: $-\EUR{4\,000} \cdot 100\% = -\EUR{4\,000}$.

\justify
Expected value without insurance: $-\EUR{100\,000} \cdot 2\% = -\EUR{2\,000}$.

The lecturer will prefer to be risk-averse and to buy the insurance. Hypothetical expected savings can never justify a difficult conversation with the wife.

\begin{frame}{Risk-neutral and real-world probabilities - 2}
\justify
People who are making investment decisions tend to be risk-averse, and this impacts the bond and CDS market.

\justify
Those buying risky bonds are not satisfied with the expected rate of return equal to the return on risk-free bonds. They demand a risk premium that compensates for the discomfort of a risky investment. Risky bonds have to be cheaper and their yields have to be higher.

\justify
Buyers of CDS fear losses during a default, so they are willing to pay more for the insurance than theoretical risk-neutral investors. Higher demand leads to higher CDS prices.

Is the bookmaker concerned about making the odds reflect true real-world probability? No! Their priority is to ensure that the losing bets are sufficient to pay the winners, regardless of the outcome. More bets on an outcome result in lower odds and higher implied probability.
